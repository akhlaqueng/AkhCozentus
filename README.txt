Online Zoo Info System/ Protype Model

1. SpringBoot 2  Back-End Tool
2. Angular 8   Front-END tool
3. MySql       RDBMS/JPA

REST API IMPLEMENTATION

Here for implementation I have considered only Zoo's Anmal Class
Attribute
     
    Id 
    AnimalName
    Type
    Qty

Here my main abstraction is that "id" of animal will
care Maximum dtatils like whether snake,wolvs,tiger etc

Like  TP2A1

is for Tiger in pen no 2 and Area 1 and so on
    
Here other model class should be Admin.. for management purposes

Here in the project variable names vary but concept is matching
    
Overall, project could be best implemented as per requirement
